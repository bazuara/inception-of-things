## Overview

Welcome to **Inception-of-Things**, a hands-on system administration project designed to explore the world of **Kubernetes**, **DevOps**, and **infrastructure automation**.  
Through this project, you’ll go from spinning up virtual machines to deploying real applications with continuous delivery pipelines, all powered by industry-standard tools.

## What This Project Covers

This project takes you on a journey through:
- Building and managing lightweight Kubernetes clusters with **K3s**.
- Simulating real infrastructure using **Vagrant** and **VirtualBox**.
- Deploying multiple **web applications** using Kubernetes **Ingress** to manage traffic based on hostnames.
- Running Kubernetes locally with **K3d** for faster iteration and testing.
- Automating deployments using **ArgoCD** and **GitHub** with a GitOps workflow.
- Managing application versions and rolling out updates directly from Git repositories.
- (Optional) Integrating a local **GitLab** instance to simulate a fully self-hosted DevOps platform.

## Technologies Used

- **Vagrant** & **VirtualBox** – Virtual infrastructure management.
- **K3s** & **K3d** – Lightweight Kubernetes for both VM-based and Docker-based environments.
- **Kubectl** – Kubernetes command-line tool.
- **Kubernetes Ingress** – Route traffic to applications based on domain names.
- **ArgoCD** – GitOps continuous delivery controller.
- **Docker & DockerHub** – Containerization and image hosting.
- **GitHub** – Version control and deployment source.
- **GitLab (Bonus)** – Local Git platform for complete DevOps workflows.

## What You'll Learn

By diving into this project, you’ll gain real-world skills in:
- Kubernetes cluster management and application deployment.
- Infrastructure automation with Vagrant and VirtualBox.
- GitOps principles using ArgoCD and GitHub.
- Continuous delivery and application versioning.
- Full DevOps lifecycle simulation with optional GitLab integration.
